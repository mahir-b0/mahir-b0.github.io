## Overview

A text adventure game programmed in Python which follows a self-directed storyline, with multiple endings that can be unlocked by various combinations of decisions throughout the gameplay.

## Rationale

Well, this game was quite a long process. I actually write a lot in my spare time, but this story specifically was one I was thinking of when I was in year 11; I just didn't know how to showcase it. It was too short and a bit too superficial to put into a short story, so I thought why not base a project around it to sharpen my Python skills. At first, the task seemed extremely daunting, but as I progressed through the code I realised writing the story was probably the harder part. Anyways, I ran into quite a few bugs, such as figuring out how to handle situations where the user inputted an invalid command (i.e. anything I hadn't accounted for in the game design), or when the user had exhausted their dialogue with a particular character. In fact, even after 'releasing' the game on Github, a few of my friends immediately pointed out some bugs which I hadn't previously noticed, such as the ending prompts not printing and instead crashing the terminal, so this was also a lesson in the importance of testing code. Overall, it was a fun project and I got some hands on experience, without much assistance, coding something purely out of passion.
