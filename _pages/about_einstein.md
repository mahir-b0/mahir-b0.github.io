Currently a 2nd year student at UNSW studying a Bachelor of Computer Science with an interest in information/cyber security.

I'm also interested in sports like MMA, football and basketball, and in my spare time I like to write, work out and watch mountaineering videos (planning to summit Kosciuszko this year).
